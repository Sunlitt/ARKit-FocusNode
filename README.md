# FocusNode

The root class here uses a class I found in Apple's documentation for ARKit apps that I wanted to have easy to use myself, and thought others would benefit from it too.

It was found inside the downloadable project on the following page:
https://developer.apple.com/documentation/arkit/handling_3d_interaction_and_ui_controls_in_augmented_reality

I've added the license from that project to this repository.

For a similar object to place into a RealityKit scene, try the [FocusEntity Repository](https://github.com/maxxfrazer/FocusEntity).

## Minimum Requirements
  - Swift 5.10
  - iOS 16.0
